    "# Generalization refers to the ability of a machine learning model to apply what it has learned from a limited set of examples \n",
    "# to new, unseen examples. It involves taking the knowledge gained from a set of training examples and extrapolating it to new \n",
    "# examples, without memorizing specific instances. The goal of generalization is to make accurate predictions on new examples \n",
    "# based on patterns learned from the training data.\n",

    "# Abstraction, on the other hand, refers to the process of representing complex information in a simplified form. \n",
    "# Abstraction is often used to reduce the complexity of a system and make it easier to understand and work with. \n",
    "# In machine learning, abstraction can be achieved by reducing the number of features in a dataset, grouping similar \n",
    "# examples together, or representing the information in a more compact form.\n",
    "\n",
